# DataQuest Project 9:  Answering Business Questions using SQL

This is the ninth project I completed in the "Data Analyst in Python" and "Data Scientist in Python" paths from Dataquest. In this project data from the chinook database was analyzed. This is a database containing sales data from a fictional music shop. Several business questions were answered during this project. The project itself teaches advanced SQL techniques. It focuses on using complex joins and queries to combine data from several tables within the database to gain access to information.

## Prerequisites

This project requires both the Jupyter notebook as well as the `DB` file containing the database with the raw information.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need `Jupyter Notebooks` with a python 3 kernel to be installed on your machine. Instructions on how to install `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

The project itself is written in Python 3 and uses the modules `Numpy`, `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, `sqlite3` and `matplotlib` to run. These can be installed by running `pip install <name of module>` in the console.
